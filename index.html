        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <!-- DONE: I want to add a link to below paragraph for "Guerillagi" in the future which takes us to "Fun Fact About My Nickname Guerillagi" title in this page. But that's enough for now (12.20.22) -->
        <p>I am Hulya, aka. <a style="color:#7868B3;" href="moreaboutme.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>Guerillagi</em></strong></a>. I started my coding
            journey while studying
            Chemical
            Engineering but realized
            I wanted to spend my life surrounded by design and coding rather than pursuing engineering. I generally
            gained
            experience in the management area; that was the path life offered me at that time. Still, I also worked as a
            Technical Suppor Specialist for approximately 1 year, so I was fortunately involved with technology. You can
            always check my <a style="color:#94D4C4;" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hulyamartli/">LinkedIn profile</a> for
            more
            details.</p>
        <p>I am also a Type 1 Diabetes warrior with other health challenges. That gave me the gift of taking on every
            difficulty
            of life with great joy and coming up with the best solutions for every situation. I like to work in
            fast-paced
            environments, which makes me feel alive and energized. The most important thing for me in my work life is to
            learn new things continuously, so I am a fan of innovation and always try to be open to new opportunities
            and
            challenges. The bottom line is I am disabled, but not really! :)</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I am all about Front-End Development and exploring ways to express myself through design and
            coding. I
            am trying to accomplish one of my dreams of being a Frontend/UI Developer/Designer, and I am in a career
            transition full of excitement, constant learning, and code to death kind of period!</p>
