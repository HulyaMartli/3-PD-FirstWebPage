    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hey there,</p>
    <!-- I want to add a link to below paragraph for "Guerillagi" in the future which takes us to "Fun Fact About My Nickname Guerillagi" title in this page. But that's enough for now (12.20.22)-->
    <p>I am Hulya, aka. <a href="#Guerillagi"><i>Guerillagi</i></a>. I started my coding journey while studying Chemical Engineering but realized
        I wanted to spend my life surrounded by design and coding rather than pursuing engineering. I generally gained
        experience in the management area; that was the path life offered me at that time. Still, I also worked as a
        Technical Suppor Specialist for approximately 1 year, so I was fortunately involved with technology. You can
        always check my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hulyamartli/">LinkedIn profile</a> for more
        details.</p>
    <p>I am also a Type 1 Diabetes warrior with other health challenges. That gave me the gift of taking on every
        difficulty
        of life with great joy and coming up with the best solutions for every situation. I like to work in fast-paced
        environments, which makes me feel alive and energized. The most important thing for me in my work life is to
        learn new things continuously, so I am a fan of innovation and always try to be open to new opportunities and
        challenges. The bottom line is I am disabled, but not really! :)</p>
    <p>Nowadays, I am all about Front-End Development and exploring ways to express myself through design and coding. I
        am trying to accomplish one of my dreams of being a Frontend/UI Developer/Designer, and I am in a career
        transition full of excitement, constant learning, and code to death kind of period!</p>
    <h3>What am I up to these days?</h3>

    <a name="Guerillagi"><h3>Fun Fact About My Nickname <i>"Guerillagi"</i></h3></a>
    <p>When I meet someone new, one of the questions they first ask is why my nickname is Guerillagi all over the place
        and what it means. So I wanted to add it here as a fun fact.</p>
    <p>In high school, I was crazy about this group called <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls">Guerilla Girls</a>. They are a group of female artists
        devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world, and their creations: the posters, slogans, etc.,
        were so amazing (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.guerrillagirls.com/">check their website</a>) that I
        always dreamed of
        being one of them. So, I am trying to remember which platform I was signing in to, but it was around 2007 or
        2008; maybe it was Twitter? :D I am not sure, though, so I was creating a new account for that platform, and I
        wanted the nickname
        "GuerillaGirl," but it was already taken, of course. :/, and then I started deleting letters to see which
        nickname was available... Guerillagi was available, and I loved the sound of it! :D Like it was meant to be my
        nickname for good. After that, I started using it everywhere on the web. So, yes, it is that boring story
        actually, nothing special about it!</p>
    <p>But it is special because my nickname means something significant to me, and it reminds me that we, women, have
        suffered a lot just because of our gender from the past to today. I don't want to believe that, but
        unfortunately, this discrimination still exists worldwide. I always thought there should be an organization like
        "Guerilla Girls" in every occupational group, which brings me to think about the place of women in the tech
        world today; unfortunately, there are so few of us in this market. I want to be one of the women who change
        that; I want to be successful in software so I can raise women's count in this sector while doing the things I
        love and enjoy: coding and design!</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for reading!</p>
