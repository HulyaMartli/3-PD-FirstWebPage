        <!-- DONE: Move Fun Fact About Guerillagi to this page-->
        <h2><span style="color:#94D4C4;">Fun Fact About My Nickname<em>"Guerillagi"</em></span></h2>
        <p>When I meet someone new, one of the questions they first ask is why my nickname is Guerillagi all over the
            place
            and what it means. So I wanted to add it here as a fun fact.</p>
        <p>In high school, I was crazy about this group called <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls"><strong><span style="color:#DC786D;">Guerilla
                        Girls</span></strong></a>. They are a
            group of female artists
            devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world, and their creations: the posters, slogans, etc.,
            were so amazing (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.guerrillagirls.com/"><span
                    style="color:#7868B3;">check their website</span></a>) that I
            always dreamed of
            being one of them. So, I am trying to remember which platform I was signing in to, but it was around 2007 or
            2008; maybe it was Twitter? :D I am not sure, though, so I was creating a new account for that platform, and
            I
            wanted the nickname
            "GuerillaGirl," but it was already taken, of course. :/, and then I started deleting letters to see which
            nickname was available... Guerillagi was available, and I loved the sound of it! :D Like it was meant to be
            my
            nickname for good. After that, I started using it everywhere on the web. So, yes, it is that boring story
            actually, nothing special about it!</p>
        <p>But it is special because my nickname means something significant to me, and it reminds me that we, women,
            have
            suffered a lot just because of our gender from the past to today. I don't want to believe that, but
            unfortunately, this discrimination still exists worldwide. I always thought there should be an organization
            like
            "Guerilla Girls" in every occupational group, which brings me to think about the place of women in the tech
            world today; unfortunately, there are so few of us in this market. I want to be one of the women who change
            that; I want to be successful in software so I can raise women's count in this sector while doing the things
            I
            love and enjoy: coding and design!</p>

        <strong>Words of wisdom from J.R.R. Tolkien I always remember in my worst days in life:</strong>
        <p>
            <b>Gandalf:</b><em> "Pity? It's a pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die
                deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells
                me that Gollum has some part to play in it, for good or evil, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may
                rule the fate of many."</em></p>
        <p><b>Frodo:</b> "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened."</p>
        <p><b>Gandalf:</b><em>"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to
                decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world,
                Frodo, besides that of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you were also meant to have
                it. And that is an encouraging thought.”</em></p>
