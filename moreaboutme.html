            <h2 style="color:#94D4C4;">Fun Fact About My Nickname<em>"Guerillagi"</em></h2>
            <p>When I meet someone new, one of the questions they first ask is why my nickname is Guerillagi all over
                the
                place
                and what it means. So I wanted to add it here as a fun fact.</p>
            <p>In high school, I was crazy about this group called <a style="color:#DC786D;" target="_blank"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls"><strong>Guerilla Girls</strong></a>. They are a
                group of female artists
                devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world, and their creations: the posters, slogans,
                etc.,
                were so amazing (<a style="color:#7868B3;" target="_blank" href="https://www.guerrillagirls.com/">check
                    their website</a>) that I
                always dreamed of
                being one of them. So, I am trying to remember which platform I was signing in to, but it was around
                2007 or
                2008; maybe it was Twitter? :D I am not sure, though, so I was creating a new account for that platform,
                and
                I
                wanted the nickname
                "GuerillaGirl," but it was already taken, of course. :/, and then I started deleting letters to see
                which
                nickname was available... Guerillagi was available, and I loved the sound of it! :D Like it was meant to
                be
                my
                nickname for good. After that, I started using it everywhere on the web. So, yes, it is that boring
                story
                actually, nothing special about it!</p>
            <p>But it is special because my nickname means something significant to me, and it reminds me that we,
                women,
                have
                suffered a lot just because of our gender from the past to today. I don't want to believe that, but
                unfortunately, this discrimination still exists worldwide. I always thought there should be an
                organization
                like
                "Guerilla Girls" in every occupational group, which brings me to think about the place of women in the
                tech
                world today; unfortunately, there are so few of us in this market. I want to be one of the women who
                change
                that; I want to be successful in software so I can raise women's count in this sector while doing the
                things
                I
                love and enjoy: coding and design!</p>

            <strong>Words of wisdom from J.R.R. Tolkien I always remember in my worst days in life:</strong>
            <p>
                <b>Gandalf:</b><em> "Pity? It's a pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that
                    die
                    deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart
                    tells
                    me that Gollum has some part to play in it, for good or evil, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo
                    may
                    rule the fate of many."</em></p>
            <p><b>Frodo:</b> "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened."</p>
            <p><b>Gandalf:</b><em>"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have
                    to
                    decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this
                    world,
                    Frodo, besides that of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you were also meant to
                    have
                    it. And that is an encouraging thought.”</em></p>
